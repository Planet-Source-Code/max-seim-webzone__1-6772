### Description

Run this at startup and it sits there waiting for an internet connection. When internet is connected, it silently FTP transfers a file from your hard-drive to your webspace folder on the internet (personal webpage). The source has good comments that explain each step. A good source for newbies wanting internet transfers. You will need to alter the sourcecode and create your own .exe file. For those that had problems downloading the zip file, here's another try ... this time I used Pkzip.
